## Customer

US manufacturing company which is a global leader in retail hardware and software equipment.

## Business Case

The company provides a prescriptive analytics platform for their large scale retail customers. The platform aggregates transaction data which is used to identify fraud, meet regulatory compliance, and improve efficiency. It needed to provide a diverse set of machine learning features which can be applied to different retail customers. The data of each customer may differ from the rest, so the platform and its machine learning features needed to be scalable across different customers.

## Solution

Our data science team implemented a set of machine learning features for the platform which could be used directly by the users from different retail companies. Some of the ML features included:

- Demand forecasting and hidden demand analysis for products with intermittent demand. The analysis helped retailers identify days on which they should increase the amounts of stock of particular products in order to maximize their sales.
- Clustering routines for user defined datasets.
- Anomaly detection routines for user defined datasets.

The main challenges of implementing the solution were:

- Scalability of the machine learning features for different customers and use cases.
- Big and messy unlabeled data that was hard to analyze.
