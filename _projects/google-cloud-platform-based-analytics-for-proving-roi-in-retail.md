## Customer

US startup providing an AI-powered style discovery platform for home furnishing retailers.

[Client Testimonial](https://www.softserveinc.com/en-us/resources/shoptelligence-gcp-data-analytics-dashboard){: target="_blank"}

## Business Case

The company's customers integrate the AI-powered modules into their e-commerce websites. The modules provide online shoppers with a better customer experience. The value for retailers is the increased customer lifetime value, ticket size and repeated visits on the website.

The challenge is to prove that the AI-powered modules actually deliver that value to the retailers. The retailers want to see how significant the ROI from those modules is. A/B tests are used for collecting data when the modules are active or inactive. However, the raw data is too complex to provide insights directly to the stakeholders.

## Solution

The developed data analytics solution is a set of Google Data Studio dashboards powered by ETL pipelines for preparing the data into a usable form.

The dashboards provide proof of the significant ROI that the AI-powered modules bring to the retailers. The insights are based on revenue and other metrics comparing the 2 sides of the A/B tests. Some of the metrics are the lift of customer lifetime value, ticket size and repeated visits on the website. The metrics are updated on a daily basis, so stakeholders can see the latest state every morning when they open the dashboards.
